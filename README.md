# Housing-MarketPlace App

This is a Housing-Marketplace App built using React and Firebase. Users can view listings either for sale or for rent. There is also a special "Offers" tab that shows places that have a special offer price listed by the landlord. Using Firebase user's can create a login account, add or edit their listing, and also get in contact with landlords about the listing.


# Technologies used
- React
- Google Firebase
- Geolocation
- Bootstrap


# Future Functionality

I would like to be able to have a carousel feature on the main page to show the pictures that the users or Landlords post to the webpage to add a better visual for the users experience.
